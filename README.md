## Introduction

Overclocking boosts your GPUâ€™s clock speeds for more performance, while undervolting cuts power use and heat. This guide focuses on **Nvidia GPUs** and uses **MSI Afterburner** to make these tweaks safe and straightforward.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you start, get these ready:

### Software:
- **MSI Afterburner**: For GPU adjustments. Set a high fan curve (e.g., 70% at 70Â°C) to keep temps in check.
- **HWiNFO**: Monitor temps, power limits, and more.

### Benchmarks:
- Use **Superposition**, **3DMark**, or **OCCT** for stability tests.  
  *Skip Furmarkâ€”itâ€™s too intense.*

## Overclocking Your GPU

Overclocking ramps up core and memory speeds for better performance. Hereâ€™s how:

### Step 1: Core Clock Boost
1. In **MSI Afterburner**, set **Core Clock** to **+75 MHz**.
2. Run a benchmark or game for **30 minutes**.
3. If stable, bump it up by **+15 MHz** (**+12.5 MHz** for Pascal GPUs like GTX 10-series).
4. If it crashes or glitches, dial it back until stable.

### Step 2: Memory Clock Boost
1. Set **Memory Clock** to **+500 MHz**.
2. Test again. If stable, increase by **+50-100 MHz**.
3. Check for **artifacts** (flickering, weird colors) or slowdowns. Lower it if they show up.

### Monitoring:
- Use **HWiNFO** to keep core temp **<80Â°C** and hotspot **<95Â°C**.
- If itâ€™s too hot, lower clocks or boost cooling.

## Testing for Stability

After tweaks, confirm your GPU is rock-solid:

### Tools:
- **Superposition** or **3DMark**.

### Instability Signs:
- Crashes, freezes, or shutdowns.
- **Artifacts** (flickering, odd colors).

### Test Time:
- Run tests for **30+ minutes**.

If issues pop up, reduce overclock or increase undervolt.

## Fixing Problems

Hit a snag? Try these:

### Boot Loop:
1. Boot into **Safe Mode** (F8 or Shift+Restart).
2. Disable overclock in **MSI Afterburner**.

### Driver Issues:
1. Use **DDU** in **Safe Mode** to wipe old drivers.
2. Install fresh **Nvidia drivers**.

Search online for deeper troubleshooting if needed.

### Monitoring:
- Watch temps and power with **HWiNFO**.
- Tweak settings if things get too warm.
